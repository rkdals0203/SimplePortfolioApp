    <string name="about_me">The first thing I should introduce is that Iâ€™m a unique and creative problem solver. Through our experience in the Google Solution Challenge, which involves solving 17 Sustainable Development Goals presented by the United Nations, I have proven that I have a creative and innovative approach to problems. This experience demonstrated the ability to solve problems through unconventional ideas and creative approaches by being selected as a top 100 finalist out of over 2,000 teams from around the world. Additionally, in the Fintech Business Model Competition, I demonstrated my ability to solve problems by developing creative solutions that go beyond traditional methods. Moreover, I have currently established a start-up team using tokenized securities and are attempting actual start-ups.</string>
